# minimalmuk Developer Tools

Adds an admin bar to toggle visual CSS debugging and a 960 grid overlay.

Caution: Some features only work properly with the [minimalmuk starter theme](https://github.com/muk-mlu-multimedia/minimalmuk). Using this on your own site probably isn't a good idea unless you want to teach the very basics of WordPress theme development.

## Credits

This plugin was originally created by [Tobias Grasse](https://tobias-grasse.net). Grid overlay adapted and expanded from [Adi Purdila's Tutsplus Tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-a-handy-grid-overlay-toolbar/).
